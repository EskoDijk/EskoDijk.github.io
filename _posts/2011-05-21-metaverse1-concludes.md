This week the <a href=\"http://www.metaverse1.org/\">Metaverse1 </a>project about technology and standardization in 3D virtual worlds successfully concluded with a final review. Over the past two and a halve years I have participated in this project with pleasure! The recent videos of the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1USyfx2lkuQ\" target=\"_blank\">3D3C conference</a> gives a nice flavour of the topics that were addressed in this project.

Especially interesting for virtual world fans and those fascinated (or scared) by the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Mirror-Worlds-Software-Universe-Shoebox-How/dp/019507906X\" target=\"_blank\">Mirror Worlds vision</a>, is the presentation by GeoSim cities - I include the YouTube video below.
