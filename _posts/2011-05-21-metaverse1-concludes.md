This week the [Metaverse1 project](http://www.metaverse1.org) on technology and standardization in 3D virtual worlds successfully concluded with a final review. Over the past two and a halve years I have participated in this project with pleasure! The YouTube videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exKohOpWXRk), [more](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=metaverse1+project)) give a nice flavour of the topics that were addressed in this project.

Metaverse1 was present on the 3D3D conference. Especially interesting for virtual world fans and those fascinated (or scared) by the [Mirror Worlds vision](https://books.google.nl/books/about/Mirror_Worlds.html?id=jh2U379fq18C&redir_esc=y) is the presentation by GeoSim cities - I include the YouTube video below.
